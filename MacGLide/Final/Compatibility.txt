Compatibility:

Performance and rendering quality:

In general, MacGLide works best when used in the MacOS X Classic environment. In this case
it can use the MacOS X OpenGL driver to render better quality images, and offers a lot more
features (like anisotropic filtering, Full Scene Antialiasing, etc.).

In MacOS 9, the performance is a little bit better, but the rendering quality is not as good
as in the Classic environment.

Compatibility:

MacGLide has been tested with a lot of several games, and with several
hardware configurations. Below is a list of games and how they do with MacGLide.


Playable Games:

Carmageddon:            Works just fine. There is just a small problem with Exposé and
                        the mouse pointer. To use the mouse, you must set the screen
                        resolution to your desktop size.

Carmageddon Splatpack:  Works just fine. Set the resolution to the desktop resolution
                        to get the mouse pointer working correctly.

Carmageddon 2:          Works fine except that in menus and the loading screen,
                        the colors of the background images are wrong. Otherwise
                        the game is fully playable.

Descent 1 & 2:          Playable, but there are issues with switching from cockpit to map
                        view. The textures become corrupt after a few switches, or the screen
                        behind the cockpit becomes blank (to resolve this you can just switch
                        the view to rear and back)
                        
Descent 3 Demo:		Works fine, with great graphics. But I have just the demo, and no
                        twin-stick, so I just gave it a quick try.
                        
Deus Ex:                Works fine except the sunglasses of some characters are sometimes 
                        white. The same goes for gun-smoke effects which are displayed
                        all the time (instead just when firing a gun). Sometimes, textured
                        landscape tiles show the wrong textures (or garbage).

DS9 - The Fallen:       Some objects in the intro seem to have problems with transparency.
                        Otherwise the game looks great but I haven't tested it a lot.

Falcon 4.0:             Works just fine. For maximum performance at 1600x1200, choose 800x600
                        in the game menu, and set Resolution=2 in the settings file.

Futurecop LAPD:         Works fine except that in version 1.02, the pause screen is corrupt.
                        But you can stick with version 1.0.

Myth The Fallen Lords:  Works fine except when you override the Glide resolution in V1.3
                        or below, the mouse pointer will not work correctly anymore.

Quake 3Dfx:             Works fine.

Rune Demo:              The Demo seems to work fine.

Tomb Raider 1 (Gold):   Works fine. Please note, that the In-Game menu has a black background,
                        except for 640x480, where you can see the dimmed paused game.
                        I believe this is actually a game feature, so don't blame me without
                        screenshots made with 3dfx hardware.

Tomb Raider 2 (Gold):   Works fine even with movies enabled with Version TR2 1.03. Earlier
                        versions of TR2 may not display everything as expected.

Tomb Raider 3:          Works fine. 

Unreal:                 Works fine.


Games with issues:

Diablo 2:               In the video driver setup dialog, the 3dfx/Glide options is greyed out
                        and can't be selected. Probably needs 3DfxGlideLib3.x to run properly
                        in 3dfx mode. However, there's a MacOS X patch available.
                        
Driver 3dfx:            The main menu screen is missing. Besides that, the game doesn't run
                        in the MaxOS X classic environment (even with software rendering).

F-18 Korea:             Hardly playable. Although the textures look correct now, there are
                        severe screen update problems in cockpit mode.

Waterrace:              Needs 3DfxGlideLib3.x to run properly in 3dfx mode.


In general, MacGLide works best when used in the MacOS X Classic environment. In this case
it can use the MacOS X OpenGL driver to render better quality images, and offers a lot more
features (like anisotropic filtering, Full Scene Antialiasing, etc.).
In MacOS 9, the performance is a little bit better, but the rendering quality is not as good
as in the Classic environment.


Tested systems on MacOS X:

MacGLide runs on any system with an OpenGL capable graphics card.

So far, I've tested MacGLide myself with the following cards:

- NVidia GForce 2MX
- NVidia 4MX
- ATI Radeon 7500
- ATI Radeon 9000
- ATI Mobility Radeon 9200

With these cards, all supported games work as described above.
But other cards will likely work without problems, too.


Same systems with MacOS 9.22:

On MacOS 9, MacGLide doesn't run very well. The development of MacGLide
is focussed on features available through the Classic environemnt.
As a result, MacOS9 users have to live with the following inconveniences:

- Fog is missing
- Unreal doesn't work with mipmaps enabled.
- In Carmageddon, textured objects loose their texture adn become white shaded.
- The MacOS 9.22 OpenGL drivers doesn't support Antialiasing.
- Chromakeying mght not work (probably caused by non-working alpha test).

If you still want to play your games on MacOS 9.22, here's some problems
I have encountered on my machines:

NVidia GForce 2MX OpenGL 1.2.2 (MacOS 9.22):

- In Myth, most objects in the game are drawn in the wrong colors.


ATI Rage 128 OpenGL Engine Version 1.1.ATI-5.99 (MacOS 9.22):

- The display in Carmageddon starts to flicker when the race starts.

- The ATI OpenGL 1.1 driver returns 32 bit as the maximum Depth Buffer bits, causing
  display errors. To get a correct display, the maximum number of depth buffer
  bits must explicitely be set to 16 in the ini-file (DepthBufferBits=16).

- Tomb Raider Gold has still zbuffer problems, even with the changed  settings.

- Unreal looks bad when mipmapping is enabled.

- In Myth, the bounding rectangle of most objects in the game ise drawn with the wrong colors
  (seems to be a problem with the Alpha test not working)

If you have a graphic card not mentioned here, please let me know your experiences.
