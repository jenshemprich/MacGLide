New in 0.13:Features:+ Improved rendering quality for Tomb Raider 1 Gold:  - geometry analysis (and correction) for removing background-colored    gaps between landscape tiles      - Runtime analysis of texture content for removing texture border    artefacts caused by anisotropic filtering/mipmapping and the way    TR1 stores its textures+ adjustable Gamma Bias+ Optimisations for the framebuffer emulation (Carmageddon, Falcon 4.0):  - Altivec Velocity Engine optimised color format conversion for maximum    performance on slower machines   - Fiddling with the cache lines in order to optimise memory bandwidth   usage on G4-based systems      - Only downloading the parts of the framebuffer to the GPU that    actually have changed, skipping any unchanged data  On my 450Mhz Cube Carmageddon now plays almost fluid with a Radeon  9000 at 1024x768. Falcon 4.0 users should also benefit from an  improved framerate, but I haven't tested this thoroughly.+ resolution cap config setting allows for setting the maximal resolution ever requested by MacGLide (useful if resolution doubling is enabled)Behind the scenes:+ Revised and extended preferences system  - Default settings for all games  - Game specific settings  - Oh yes, older settings are again reset (hopefully for the last time)+ Code refactoring as a preparation for Control Panel+ Code refactoring as a preparation for texture replacment  (a la Tomb Raider Xtra)Bugfixes:0.13rc1:- F/A-18 and Descent 1&2 are playable on older graphics cards  like GeForce 2mx and similar- Fixed possible memory crash on exit0.13b1:- Installer includes uncompressed files for the rare cases where  it doesn't work- TR1 with gapfix enabled: pixel garbage into last row/column has  been removed- minor performance optimisations- F/A-18 fully playable: texture problems and framebuffer issues fixed.0.13a2:- The installer is working again  (at least it did on one of the systems that users previously  reported as non-working)0.13a1:- Restoring the desktop gamma corection value should be more compatible- Gaps in menu screen of Carmageddon 2 and TR3 resolved- Gaps in TR2 main menu at resolutions higher than 640x480 alleviated  (some have gone, but others are still visible if you look closely)  New in 0.12:Features:+ Gamma Correction (ColorSync must be installed)+ Better performance (Especially in Carmageddon :^)Bug fixes:+ FutureCop radar and dispatcher window working,  V1.02 not crashing anymore when pausing the game+ Carmagddon retro mirror working+ Carmageddon Map 3D-View working in all situations+ Fixed crash when moving the cursor in Carmageddon Movie mode+ Quake 3Dfx is working (actually it did all the time but  it just wanted exactly 2M framebuffer/texture RAM)+ Descent 1+2 display the cockpit and instruments+ Switching between (emulated) Glide display and   Mac-Passthrough display preserves the color depth+ Full support for undocumented Delta0 mode  (no more special cases for Tomb Raider and Carmageddon)New in 0.11:Features:+ New rendering engine (more accurate than in 0.10.1) allows better quality  on suitable graphics cards (ATI 7500 and later or similar NVidia cards).  Also fixes some rendering glitches such as the haze in Falcon 4.0 (which didn't  show up in 0.10.1).  To get the higher quality rendering, you need a graphics card with at least 3  texture units, for example an ATI Radeon 7500. Smaller cards like NVidia GForce  2mx or ATI Rage 128 will still use the simple rendering mode, and things will  continue to look like in 0.10.1.+ Full Scene AntiAliasing (FSAA) for ATI chips (only in the Classic environment)+ Global texture smoothing and mipmapping+ Tweaked a code a little to gain more speed on slower systems (does anyone notice?)+ Original 3dfx-splash animation is displayed when starting a game in order to achive  a more authentic appearence.+ Better resource management+ Added better support for pixel pipeline framebuffer writes.+ Reorganised the code base+ Lots of bugfixes and smaller improvementsBugfixes:Fixed in 0.11:+ Menu backgrounds in Carmageddon 2+ Psychedelic colors in Falcon 4.0 on Dual G5 machines with ATI 9600XT+ Settings folder has been renamed to "MacGLide" in order to comply to the product nameFixed in 0.11b1:+ Several issues with the frame buffer emulation when pixel pipeline is active.+ Unused texture units are disabled in order to speed up rendering.+ Fa/18 Korea looks better because of fixes in the pixel pipeline frame buffer emulation (still not playable).+ Fixed the color of the "3D" in the splash screen animationFixed in 0.11a2: + If the exact screen size isn't found, MacGLide tries to choose a slightly larger one.+ Carmageddon 2: Menu backgrounds and loading screen images are now showing up. However,  the colors are wrong so this needs some more investigation.+ FutureCop LAPD Demo: Ammo count digits and some other parts of the headup display are  not displayed correctly in the first level in single player. However, the ammo count  digits are now visible in multi player mode. But I have just the demo, so I can't tell  much about the full version (needs also some more investigation).+ Tomb Raider 3: The in-game menu background now shows the current game scene in black & white.+ Fa/18 Korea looks better because of texture format fixes  Fixed in 0.11a1: + Objects in Carmageddon (and probably other games) don't loose their transparency  anymore when the fog becomes thicker.+ Tomb Raider 1 Gold: Switching to the In-Game menu got a bit faster.+ Less white screen appearence during screen resolution changes+ Improved memory management hopefully fixes sudden exits in Falcon 4.0 that happended  to some users when firing a rocket.+ Haze in Falcon 4.0 rendered correctly.+ Translucent Menu backgrounds in Tomb Raider 1 Gold.+ Translucent Lightnings in Tomb Raider 1 Gold.+ Fixed the multicolored skidmarks in Carmageddon (Splatpack).New in 0.10:Features:+ Games can be played in any resolution whatever the monitor/LCD-display/hardware supports  (See Readme.txt on how to enable this)+ Configuration files are now stored in the System Preferences Folder in the subfolder  "OpenGLide Settings".Bugfixes:Fixed in 0.10.1:+ Fixed wrong screen resolution after flying a mission in Falcon 4.0Fixed in 0.10:+ Screenshots in Falcon 4.0 have not been rendered correctlyFixed in 0.10b3:+ Fixed making screenshots in Falcon 4 for Resolution settings other than 1+ Fixed issues with logging searching for the display mode  (resolution, colordepth haven't been reported correctly)+ Config file from previous version is correctly replaced with default settingsFixed in 0.10b2:+ Fixed a startup problem on machines that do not report a screen refresh rate  (that's usally Macs with built-in LCD-Display, like the iMac, or Macs connected to a  Cinema display via DVI/ADC)+ Fixed a startup problem on machines that don't support resolutions below 640x480  Fixed in 010b1:+ Falcon 4.0 can be played in True Color+ Tomb Raider can be played with movies enabled+ Enhanced display quality in Falcon 4.0 by enabling anisotropic filtering  (has caused purple pixel artefacts on buildings/bridges/plane artwork in 0.09)+ Enhanced display quality in Carmagedon by sorting out some rendering artefacts  when Anisotropic filtering was enabled (for instance on skidmarks)  + Fixed crash in Falcon 4.0 when starting a second mission+ Fixed crash in Falcon 4.0 on firing a rocket or if an explosion was occuring  (some users had reported this problem while it worked for me and others)+ Fixed problem with displaying the health status bar in Tomb Raider Gold 1+ No more depth buffer problems on chipsets with 32bit depth buffer  (for instance at the starting point of the first level of Tomb Raider Gold 1  the portal was not rendered correctly in 0.09)  New in 0.09:+ Fixed a bug that made white dots appear in the landscape in Falcon 4.0,  and in other games that use 64x64 pixel textures   (Carmageddon also uses a lot of 64x64 bit textures)+ Optimised memory allocation  (may solve performance degration during longer sessions)  + Using Altivec in some cases (if the compiler feels like)+ Compiler settings have been optimised to minimise the memory footprint  (with the intention to fit into the 1st/2nd level cache)  + Added ability to use complied vertex arrays to speed up the rendering+ Mipmapping enabled by default+ Anisotropic filtering default value  set to 16  to achive the best rendering quality+ Minor speed improvements by tweaking the codeNew in 0.009rc3:+ Fixed remaining Falcon 4.0 missing cockpit displays.+ Fixed invisible Myth In-Game dialogs  (did already work in the betas but was broken in 0.09rc2)+ Fixed transparent areas in Myth In-Game-dialogs+ Fixed distorted landscape tiles in Myth  (actually that one has already been fixed in 0.09rc2)+ Minor speed improvementsNew in 0.009rc2:+ Fixes for Falcon 4.0:  * Canopy reflections and smoke effects appear correct.  * Blue areas in virtual cockpit mode and the purple dots on areas/objects    are gone (for instance the HUD or some weapons labels, probably others    as well).    * HUD texts are now readable.
