Installation:


With the Installer:

Just doubleclick the installer and follow the instructions. You'll get
a folder on the desktop with all the necessary readme files (since
you're reading this you've probably already done it) .


Installing from an archive:

To install, unstuff the archive (since you're reading this you've
probably already done it) and drag the file 3DfxGlideLib2.x onto your
your MacOS9 System folder. You will be asked if you want to place it
in the System Extensions folder. Answer Yes. Alternatively, you can
place it in the System Extensions Folder manually.
