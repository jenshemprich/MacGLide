Configuration:

MacGLide stores its settings in the "MacGLide Settings" subfolder of the
Preferences Folder in the MacOS 9 System Folder. There can be settings for
each game, but normally you're just editing the default settings, which
apply to all games. The files are created when you run a game the first
time.


The most important settings:


Resolution=n	Overrides the screen resolution

	values from 1 to 8 are used to multiply the resolution requested by
	the game.

	Example: With Resolution=2 and the game requests 800x600, the
	         screen resolution will be actually 1600x1200.
	         Because the game still thinks it 800x600, you might
	         achive higher framerates for games that extensively
	         write to the framebuffer (for instance Falcon 4.0).

	Greater values override the requested resolution with a fixed value:

	Example: Resolution=1024 sets the screen resolution to 1024x768
	         regardless what the game requests (handy if you're using
	         a LCD with that resolution).


FullSceneAntiAliasing=n	Sets the amount of samples to be used for antialiasing.

	Values greater than 1 enable full scene antialiasing
	(improves rendering quality a lot)

	Example: FullSceneAntiAliasing=4 uses 4 samples to render a pixel. The
	         maximum value depends on the amount of VRAM of your video card
	         and the screen resolution.
	         So if your set the value too high, FSAA may cease to work. In
	         this case, you have either to decrease the screen resolution
	         or the FSAA value.


TextureSmoothing=n	Improves rendering quality by enabling global texture
	                  smoothing and mipmapping for all objects.

	A value of 1 (default) enables texture smoothing, a value of 0 disables
	it. When enabled, all textures (instead of just the ones chosen by the
	game) are rendered smoothly (using the OpenGL linear filter). If
	mipmaps are enabled (they are by default) all textures are also
	mipmapped.


MonitorRefreshRate=n	Overrides the vertical screen refesh rate.

	Values from >=60 set the vertical screen refresh rate to n.
	Example: MonitorRefreshRate=75 sets the vertical screen refresh rate to
	75Hz. Some games doesn't allow to change the refresh rate, but you can
	change it here.
	
All other default values are chosen for each game to provide the best quality/
compatibility, so it shouldn't be necessary to change them.

For other setings, see the hints at the top of the ini-file for details.


Memory usage:

In order to get a game running with MacGLide on a MacOS 9 system and to avoid
a sudden exit to the finder, you must raise its memory partition by
about 50000K. When started in the MacOS X classic environment, the memory
setting can be left as it as.
