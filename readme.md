# Abstreact
MacGLide is a shared library for Apple Macintosh PowerPC computers that emulates 3Dfx Voodoo Graphics hardware. It makes it possible to run games originally made for 3Dfx/Glide without the hardware by translating Glide-function calls to OpenGL.

# last hurrah
I've hard-forked (read copied) this project from OpenGLide back in 2003. Over the years I was able to run almost every 3dfx-game published for OS9. Besides the emulation there has been support for custom resolutions, anti-aliasing, scene geometry enhancing, and so on, all easily accessible from OSX by the MacOS classic environment.

Finally, when I just started having a very good time, Apple decided to give up on the PowerPC, abandoned OS9 Classic and thereby grounded the project.
